# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

* Re-architected the repository layout:
  * Java source moved to `extension/src/main/java`
  * All java classes are now under the `ortus.extension.orm` package
  * Dropped the java source format-on-push in favor of format-on-save IDE tooling
* Re-architected all extension tests:
  * Internal tests rewritten to native Testbox specs
  * Cloned all ORM tests from the Lucee repository
  * Updated to TestBox 5.0
* The extension will now throw an error if you try to configure an unsupported cache provider like `"jbosscache"`, `"swarmcache"`, etc. Previously, the extension would silently switch to ehcache if any cache provider besides EHCache was configured.

### Fixed

* The `.fld` definition file for all built-ins was missed during the conversion to a Maven build. (Since [45.4.29.25](https://github.com/Ortus-Solutions/extension-hibernate/releases/tag/v5.4.29.25)). This caused the `orm*()` and `entity*()` built-in method calls to be picked up by Lucee core before being routed to this extension. No known errors resulted from this mistake, but we feel embarrassed anyway. ðŸ˜…
* Clear ORM context data once per ORM reload, not once per ORM entity parsing. This should improve ORM startup/reload time and avoid difficult session or cache manager lifecycle issues.

## [5.4.29.28] - 2023-06-07

### Fixed

We now set the JAXB `ContextFactory` system property based on the JRE version. If less than JRE 11, we set `javax.xml.bind.context.factory=com.sun.xml.bind.v2.ContextFactory`. If JRE 11 or greater, we set `javax.xml.bind.JAXBContextFactory=com.sun.xml.bind.v2.ContextFactory`.

This prevents the following warning from being logged on each ORM method call:

```
WARNING: Using non-standard property: javax.xml.bind.context.factory. Property javax.xml.bind.JAXBContextFactory should be used instead.
```

See [OOE-3](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/OOE-3).

## [5.4.29.27] - 2023-05-29

### Fixed

- We now set a `javax.xml.bind.context.factory=com.sun.xml.bind.v2.ContextFactory` System property to ensure the JAXB API can find its implementation in CommandBox environments. This may trigger a log message, but shouldn't cause any concern. Vanilla Tomcat installations *may* need to overwrite or clear this property. [LDEV-4276](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/)

## [5.4.29.26] - 2023-05-24

### Changed

- Improved logo for Lucee admin ðŸ¤©

### Fixed

- Entity changes made in `onPreInsert()` and `onPreUpdate()` do not persist [OOE-2](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/OOE-2)

## [5.4.29.25] - 2023-05-23

### Changed

- Switched to Maven for a faster, more stable build process
- Improved entity event listeners for a much speedier ORM startup ([8924b58a9058d296e2a783ccfabbf90e26dc9c1b](https://github.com/Ortus-Solutions/extension-hibernate/commit/8924b58a9058d296e2a783ccfabbf90e26dc9c1b))
- New and Improved logo for Lucee admin visibility ([10bdf56a7a78f0221ab1a6e66a5512a92819e5b7](https://github.com/Ortus-Solutions/extension-hibernate/commit/10bdf56a7a78f0221ab1a6e66a5512a92819e5b7))

### Fixed

- Entity has no state when listener method (`onPreInsert`, for example) is fired ([014814263b5d31b8bac4c17479c2ca731ceb4e7c](https://github.com/Ortus-Solutions/extension-hibernate/commit/014814263b5d31b8bac4c17479c2ca731ceb4e7c), [OOE-1](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/OOE-1))

## [5.4.29.23] - 2023-05-15

### Fixed

- ORMExecuteQuery ignores `"unique"` argument if `options` struct is passed

## [5.4.29.22] - 2023-05-11

- Session close on transaction end ([LDEV-4017](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-4017))
- "length" not used on varchar fields ([LDEV-4150](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-4150))

### Changed
